Oracle Coding Challenge

I read through the challenge and had more questions than answers.   I have written scripts that would be run against the usual 3 environments - DEV, TEST & PROD.  I assumed, rightly or wrongly, that schema and tablespaces had been created and I have used a user call LIVE. 
The 2 reports I wrote in SQL I would normally hang from a menu - with a generic parameter form called from the menu option. I haven't included SET MARKUP for xls, as this would be user preference.
