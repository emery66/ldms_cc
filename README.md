Oracle Coding Challenge

I read through the challenge and had more questions than answers!  Initially I think I overcomplicated the exercise and brought my focus back to 'Quick Coding Challenge'.

I have worked on some assumptions.  The schema and tablespaces have been created and there are db roles and users. 
The functions and procedures could all belong to a 'Widgets' package.

As far as testing is concerned I would normally hold all the code in Tortoise SVN and run it in 3 environments - DEV, TEST & PROD.  I would embed any DML scripts in a text file and spool the results to save in SVN.
